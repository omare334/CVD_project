# CVD_project
This repo contains the code for my main research project which is Phenogrouping patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing catheter ablation <br />
 To do this I will train a CNN using the surface ECG as input and the intracardiac electrogram as the output to be able to quantify intracardiac electrical activity from the surface ECG alone. Use the features generated by this CNN for phenogrouping
#Preprocessing 
Here most of the pre-processing is actually just really the data extraction and cleaning, excluding anyone that doesn't have 60 seconds worth of samples which at 1000hz is 60,000 samples and preventing data leakages, we can not have the same patient in the train and validation dataset. Also I can't show you the data cleaning pipeline just yet as it is private info so I need to see how much I can share. I may just share the code for other people who need to extract ecg from txt files.
