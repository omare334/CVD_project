This repo contains the code for my main research project which is Phenogrouping patients with atrial fibrillation undergoing catheter ablation <br />
 To do this I will train a CNN using the surface ECG as input and the intracardiac electrogram as the output to be able to quantify intracardiac electrical activity from the surface ECG alone. Use the features generated by this CNN for phenogrouping
