	abstract = {Chronic atrial fibrillation ({AF}) as a precursor of stroke was assessed over 24 years of follow-up of the general population sample at Framingham, Massachusetts. Persons with chronic established {AF}, with or without rheumatic heart disease ({RHD}), are at greatly increased risk of stroke, and the stroke is probably due to embolism. Chronic {AF} in the absence of {RHD} is associated with more than a fivefold increase in stroke incidence, while {AF} with {RHD} has a 17-fold increase. Stroke occurrence increased as duration of {AF} increased, with no evidence of a particularly vulnerable period. Chronic idiopathic {AF} is an important precursor of cerebral embolism. Controlled trials of anticoagulants or antiarrhythmic agents in persons with chronic {AF} may demonstrate if strokes can be prevented in this highly susceptible group.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. It has been estimated that 6-12 million people worldwide will suffer this condition in the {US} by 2050 and 17.9 million people in Europe by 2060. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and provokes important economic burden along with significant morbidity and mortality.
{AIM}: We provide here comprehensive and updated statistics on worldwide epidemiology of atrial fibrillation.
{METHODS}: An electronic search was conducted for atrial fibrillation. The epidemiologic information was retrieved from the Global Health Data Exchange database, which is regarded as one of the most comprehensive worldwide catalogs of surveys, censuses, vital statistics, and other health-related data.
{RESULTS}: A total of 3.046 million new cases of atrial fibrillation worldwide were registered in the database during 2017. The estimated incidence rate for 2017 (403/millions inhabitants) was 31\% higher than the corresponding incidence in 1997. The worldwide prevalence of atrial fibrillation is 37,574 million cases (0.51\% of worldwide population), increased also by 33\% during the last 20 years. The highest burden is seen in countries with high socio-demographic index, though the largest recent increased occurred in middle socio-demographic index countries. Future projections suggest that absolute atrial fibrillation burden may increase by {\textgreater}60\% in 2050.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our analyses suggest that atrial fibrillation incidence and prevalence have increased over the last 20 years and will continue to increase over the next 30 years, especially in countries with middle socio-demographic index, becoming one of the largest epidemics and public health challenges.},

	shorttitle = {Epidemiology of atrial fibrillation},
	abstract = {In the last 20 years, atrial fibrillation ({AF}) has become one of the most important public health problems and a significant cause of increasing health care costs in western countries. The prevalence of {AF} is increasing due to our greater ability to treat chronic cardiac and noncardiac diseases, and the improved ability to suspect and diagnose {AF}. At the present time, the prevalence of {AF} (2\%) is double that reported in the last decade. The prevalence of {AF} varies with age and sex. {AF} is present in 0.12\%–0.16\% of those younger than 49 years, in 3.7\%–4.2\% of those aged 60–70 years, and in 10\%–17\% of those aged 80 years or older. In addition, it occurs more frequently in males, with a male to female ratio of 1.2:1. The incidence of {AF} ranges between 0.21 and 0.41 per 1,000 person/years. Permanent {AF} occurs in approximately 50\% of patients, and paroxysmal and persistent {AF} in 25\% each. {AF} is frequently associated with cardiac disease and comorbidities. The most common concomitant diseases are coronary artery disease, valvular heart disease, and cardiomyopathy. The most common comorbidities are hypertension, diabetes, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal failure, stroke, and cognitive disturbance. Paroxysmal {AF} occurs in younger patients and with a reduced burden of both cardiac disease and comorbidities. Generally, the history of {AF} is long, burdened by frequent recurrences, and associated with symptoms (in two thirds of patients). Patients with {AF} have a five-fold and two-fold higher risk of stroke and death, respectively. We estimate that the number of patients with {AF} in 2030 in Europe will be 14–17 million and the number of new cases of {AF} per year at 120,000–215,000. Given that {AF} is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, this increasing number of individuals with {AF} will have major public health implications.},

	abstract = {The progression from paroxysmal atrial fibrillation ({AF}) to persistent or long-term persistent forms has recently gained increasing attention. A growing amount of data has shown a significant morbidity and mortality associated with the transition. The aim of our systematic review was to assess the evidence regarding {AF} progression rates with different management approaches. Electronic databases were searched by using text words and relevant indexing to capture data on {AF} progression. Studies that considered progression from paroxysmal {AF} to a persistent or permanent form were included. The papers collected were divided into 2 groups: 1) general population studies (with almost exclusively medical therapy); and 2) studies that consider progression of {AF} subsequent to {AF} ablation. Twenty-one studies were included in the first group and 8 in the second group. In the first group, percentage of {AF} progression at 1 year ranged from 10\% to 20\%. Studies that included a longer follow-up detected a higher percentage of progression (from 50\% to 77\% after 12 years). In patients treated with catheter ablation, the percentage of progression was significantly lower (from 2.4\% to 2.7\% at 5 years’ follow-up). The percentage of progression after catheter ablation did not change according to duration of follow-up. {AF} ablation is associated with significantly reduced progression to persistent forms compared with studies in the general population. Prevention of long-term {AF} progression may be a clinically relevant outcome after {AF} ablation. Further research is required to determine whether delaying progression of {AF} by catheter ablation reduces morbidity and mortality.},

	abstract = {Background. It is well known that the pulmonary veins ({PVs}), especially their myocardial sleeves play a critical role in the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation. Understanding the {PV} anatomy is crucial for the safety and efficacy of all procedures performed on {PVs}. The aim of this study was to present normal distal {PV} anatomy and to create a juxtaposition of all {PV} ostium variants., Methods. A total of 130 randomly selected autopsied adult human hearts (Caucasian) were examined. The number of {PVs} ostia was evaluated and their diameter was measured. The ostium-to-last-tributary distance and macroscopic presence of myocardial sleeves were also evaluated., Results. Five hundred forty-one {PV} ostia were identified. Four classical {PV} ostia patterns (two left and two right {PVs}) were observed in 70.8\% of all cases. The most common variant was the classical pattern with additional middle right {PV} (19.2\%), followed by the common ostium for the left superior and the inferior {PVs} (4.44\%). Mean diameters of {PV} ostia (for the classical pattern) were: left superior = 13.8 ± 2.9 mm; left inferior = 13.3 ± 3.4 mm; right superior = 14.3 ± 2.9 mm; right inferior = 13.7 ± 3.3 mm. When present, the additional middle right {PV} ostium had the smallest {PV} ostium diameter in the heart (8.2 ± 4.1 mm). The mean ostium-to-last-tributary (closest to the atrium) distances were: left superior = 15.1 ± 4.6 mm; left inferior = 13.5 ± 4.0 mm; right superior = 11.8 ± 4.0 mm; right inferior = 11.0 ± 3.7 mm. There were no statistically significant differences between sexes in ostia diameters and ostium-to-last-tributary distances., Conclusion. Only 71\% of the cases have four standard pulmonary veins. The middle right pulmonary vein is present in almost 20\% of patients. Presented data can provide useful information for the clinicians during interventional procedures or radiologic examinations of {PVs}.},

	abstract = {Antiarrhythmic Drugs in {AF}. Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) remains a challenge to medical therapy. Over the past several years, a variety of experimental models of {AF} have been developed. These have provided insights into mechanisms underlying {AF} and antiarrhythmic drug action against the arrhythmia. A variety of drugs effective against clinical {AK}, including flecainide. propafenone, procainamide, and sotalol, have been found to terminate experimental {AF}, All of these agents appear to act by prolonging the wavelength for atrial reentry at rapid rates, thereby increasing the size and decreasing the number of functional circuits maintaining the arrhythmia. While the ability to terminate {AF} is determined by refractoriness prolongation at rapid rates, refractoriness prolongation at slow rates (e.g., sinus rhythm) can prevent {AF} induction by premature beats. Thus, drugs with strong reverse use-dependence (like sotalol) may be much more effective in preventing than in terminating {AF}. Spacial heterogeneity in refractoriness is an important contributor to {AF} occurrence in some models, particularly vagal {AF}, and is reduced by some (but not all) drugs that terminate {AF}, New insights are being gained into mechanisms of electrical remodeling, which promotes {AF} maintenance when rapid atrial rates are maintained, such as during {AF}, This electrical remodeling may be an interesting novel target for therapy of {AF}, Insights into {AF} mechanisms obtained in experimental models of {AF} should help in the development of new and improved therapeutic approaches.},

We aimed to identify different groups of {AF} patients who shared common clinical phenotypes using cluster analysis and evaluate the association between identified clusters and clinical outcomes. Methods: We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis in {AF} patients from {AMADEUS} and {BOREALIS} trials. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke/thromboembolism ({TE}), cardiovascular ({CV}) death, myocardial infarction, and/or all-cause death. Individual components of the primary outcome and major bleeding were also assessed. Results: We included 3980 {AF} patients treated with the Vitamin-K Antagonist from the {AMADEUS} and {BOREALIS} studies. The analysis identified four clusters in which patients varied significantly among clinical characteristics. Cluster 1 was characterized by patients with low rates of {CV} risk factors and comorbidities; Cluster 2 was characterized by patients with a high burden of {CV} risk factors; Cluster 3 consisted of patients with a high burden of {CV} comorbidities; Cluster 4 was characterized by the highest rates of non-{CV} comorbidities. After a mean follow-up of 365 (standard deviation 187) days, Cluster 4 had the highest cumulative risk of outcomes. Compared with Cluster 1, Cluster 4 was independently associated with an increased risk for the composite outcome (hazard ratio ({HR}) 2.43, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.70–3.46), all-cause death ({HR} 2.35, 95\% {CI} 1.58–3.49) and major bleeding ({HR} 2.18, 95\% {CI} 1.19–3.96). Conclusions: Cluster analysis identified four different clinically relevant phenotypes of {AF} patients that had unique clinical characteristics and different outcomes. Cluster analysis highlights the high degree of heterogeneity in patients with {AF}, suggesting the need for a phenotype-driven approach to comorbidities, which could provide a more holistic approach to management aimed to improve patients’ outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objectives Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is a heterogeneous condition. We performed a cluster analysis in a cohort of patients with {AF} and assessed the prognostic implication of the identified cluster phenotypes.
Methods We used two multicentre, prospective, observational registries of {AF}: the {SAKURA} {AF} registry (Real World Survey of Atrial Fibrillation Patients Treated with Warfarin and Non-vitamin K Antagonist Oral Anticoagulants) (n=3055, derivation cohort) and the {RAFFINE} registry (Registry of Japanese Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Focused on anticoagulant therapy in New Era) (n=3852, validation cohort). Cluster analysis was performed by the K-prototype method with 14 clinical variables. The endpoints were all-cause mortality and composite cardiovascular events.
Results The analysis subclassified derivation cohort patients into five clusters. Cluster 1 (n=414, 13.6\%) was characterised by younger men with a low prevalence of comorbidities; cluster 2 (n=1003, 32.8\%) by a high prevalence of hypertension; cluster 3 (n=517, 16.9\%) by older patients without hypertension; cluster 4 (n=652, 21.3\%) by the oldest patients, who were mainly female and with a high prevalence of heart failure history; and cluster 5 (n=469, 15.3\%) by older patients with high prevalence of diabetes and ischaemic heart disease. During follow-up, the risk of all-cause mortality and composite cardiovascular events increased across clusters (log-rank p{\textless}0.001, p{\textless}0.001). Similar results were found in the external validation cohort.
Conclusions Machine learning-based cluster analysis identified five different phenotypes of {AF} with unique clinical characteristics and different clinical outcomes. The use of these phenotypes may help identify high-risk patients with {AF}.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, the deep learning ({DL}) computing paradigm has been deemed the Gold Standard in the machine learning ({ML}) community. Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of {ML}, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of {DL} is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The {DL} field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, {DL} has outperformed well-known {ML} techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on {DL}, all of them only tackled one aspect of the {DL}, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of {DL}. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of {DL} and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of {DL}, presents the types of {DL} techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) which the most utilized {DL} network type and describes the development of {CNNs} architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the {AlexNet} network and closing with the High-Resolution network ({HR}.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major {DL} applications. Computational tools including {FPGA}, {GPU}, and {CPU} are summarized along with a description of their influence on {DL}. The paper ends with the evolution matrix, benchmark datasets, and summary and conclusion.},

backpropagation, the learning rate parameter can have a significant effect on generalization accuracy. In particular, decreasing the
learning rate below that which yields the fastest convergence can significantly improve generalization accuracy, especially on large, complex problems. The learning rate also directly affects training speed, but not necessarily in the way that many people expect. Many neural network practitioners currently attempt to use the largest learning rate that still allows for convergence, in order to improve training speed. However, a learning rate that is too large can be as slow as a learning rate that is too small, and a learning rate that is too large or too small can require orders of magnitude more training time than one that is in an appropriate range. The paper illustrates how the learning rate affects training speed and generalization accuracy, and thus gives guidelines on how to efficiently select a learning rate that maximizes generalization accuracy},

	abstract = {The memorization effect of deep neural network ({DNN}) plays a pivotal role in many state-of-the-art label-noise learning methods. To exploit this property, the early stopping trick, which stops the optimization at the early stage of training, is usually adopted. Current methods generally decide the early stopping point by considering a {DNN} as a whole. However, a {DNN} can be considered as a composition of a series of layers, and we find that the latter layers in a {DNN} are much more sensitive to label noise, while their former counterparts are quite robust. Therefore, selecting a stopping point for the whole network may make different {DNN} layers antagonistically affected each other, thus degrading the final performance. In this paper, we propose to separate a {DNN} into different parts and progressively train them to address this problem. Instead of the early stopping, which trains a whole {DNN} all at once, we initially train former {DNN} layers by optimizing the {DNN} with a relatively large number of epochs. During training, we progressively train the latter {DNN} layers by using a smaller number of epochs with the preceding layers fixed to counteract the impact of noisy labels. We term the proposed method as progressive early stopping ({PES}). Despite its simplicity, compared with the early stopping, {PES} can help to obtain more promising and stable results. Furthermore, by combining {PES} with existing approaches on noisy label training, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on image classification benchmarks.},

	abstract = {1D Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) have recently become the state-of-the-art technique for crucial signal processing applications such as patient-specific {ECG} classification, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection in power electronics circuitry and motor-fault detection. This is an expected outcome as there are numerous advantages of using an adaptive and compact 1D {CNN} instead of a conventional (2D) deep counterparts. First of all, compact 1D {CNNs} can be efficiently trained with a limited dataset of 1D signals while the 2D deep {CNNs}, besides requiring 1D to 2D data transformation, usually need datasets with massive size, e.g., in the "Big Data" scale in order to prevent the well-known "overfitting" problem. 1D {CNNs} can directly be applied to the raw signal (e.g., current, voltage, vibration, etc.) without requiring any pre- or post-processing such as feature extraction, selection, dimension reduction, denoising, etc. Furthermore, due to the simple and compact configuration of such adaptive 1D {CNNs} that perform only linear 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions), a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible. This paper reviews the major signal processing applications of compact 1D {CNNs} with a brief theoretical background. We will present their state-of-the-art performances and conclude with focusing on some major properties.},

Manual electrocardiogram ({ECG}) interpretation for its diagnosis is tedious, time-consuming, requires high expertise, and suffers from inter- and intra-observer variability. Deep learning techniques could be exploited in order for robust arrhythmia detection models to be designed. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid neural model utilizing focal loss, an improved version of cross-entropy loss, to deal with training data imbalance. {ECG} features initially extracted via a Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) are input to a Long Short-Term Memory ({LSTM}) model for temporal dynamics memorization and thus, more accurate classification into the four {ECG} rhythm types, namely normal (N), atrial fibrillation ({AFIB}), atrial flutter ({AFL}) and {AV} junctional rhythm (J). The model was trained on the {MIT}-{BIH} Atrial Fibrillation Database and achieved a sensitivity of 97.87\%, and specificity of 99.29\% using a ten-fold cross-validation strategy. The proposed model can aid clinicians to detect common atrial fibrillation in real-time on routine screening {ECG}.},

The pre-processed {ECG} signals are given to the combined network of {AE}-{biLSTM}. The proposed {AE}-{biLSTM} method contains an encoder that extracts higher level feature from the Electro cardiogram arrhythmias signals using bidirectional long short- term memory ({biLSTM}) network, then a decoder output reconstruct Electro cardiogram arrhythmias signals from higher level features using {biLSTM} network. Finally, the proposed method accurately classifies the 6 heartbeats types, such as normal (N) sinus beat, atrial fibrillation ({AFIB}), ventricular bigeminy (B), pacing beat (P), atrial flutter ({AFL}), sinus brady cardia ({SBR}).

	abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation ({AF}) is an arrhythmia commonly encountered in clinical practice. There is a high risk of thromboembolism in patients with {AF}. Nonlinear analyses such as electroencephalogram ({EEG}), electrocardiogram ({ECG}), and respiratory movement have been used to quantify biological signals, and sample entropy ({SampEn}) has been employed as a statistical measure to evaluate complex systems. In this study, we examined the values of {SampEn} in {ECG} signals for patients with and without {AF} to measure the regularity and complexity.

Methods
{ECG} signals of lead {II} were recorded from 34 subjects without arrhythmia and 15 patients with chronic {AF} in a supine position. The {ECG} signals were converted into time-series data and {SampEn} was calculated.

Results
The {SampEn} values for the group without arrhythmia were 0.252 ± 0.114 [time lag (τ) = 1] and 0.533 ± 0.163 (τ = 5), and those for the chronic {AF} group were 0.392 ± 0.158 (τ = 1) and 0.759 ± 0.246 (τ = 5). The values of {SampEn} were significantly higher in the group with chronic {AF} than in the group without arrhythmia (P {\textless} 0.01 for τ = 1, P {\textless} 0.004 for τ = 5). The constructed three-dimensional vectors were plotted in time-delayed three-dimensional space. We used time lags of τ = 5 and τ = 1. The shape of the loops of the three-dimensional space was better for τ = 5.

Conclusion
The values of {SampEn} from {ECG} for chronic {AF} patients were higher than for subjects without arrhythmia, suggesting greater complexity for the time-series from chronic {AF} patients. {SampEn} is considered a new index for evaluating complex systems in {ECG}.},

However, {LA} volume ({LAV}) is more accurate in assessing {LA} size. Studies evaluating {LAV} as a predictor of {AF} recurrence are contradictory; therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to assess whether {LAV} is an independent predictor of {AF} recurrence following {RFA}.All studies reporting {LAV}/{LAV} index ({LAVi}) as a predictor of {AF} recurrence following {RFA} were included. For studies reporting mean {LAV}/ {LAVi} in patients with and without {AF} recurrence, standard difference in means ({SDM}) and standard errors were calculated, and combined using meta-analytical techniques. For studies reporting adjusted odds ratio ({OR}) for {AF} recurrence based on {LAV}/{LAVi}, log {ORs} were combined using generic inverse variance. Twenty one studies (3822 subjects) were included. Meta-analysis of 11 studies (1559 subjects) reporting {LAV}, showed that patients with {AF} recurrence had a higher mean {LA} volume compared to patients with no recurrence ({SDM} 0.801; {CI} 0.387–1.216). Data from 9 studies (1425 subjects) comparing {LAVi} showed that, patients with {AF} recurrence had a higher mean {LAVi} compared to patients with no recurrence ({SDM}-0.596; {CI} 0.305–0.888). Thirteen studies (2886 patients) reporting {ORs} for {AF} recurrence based on {LAV}/ {LAVi}, showed that {LAV}/{LAVi} was independently predictive of {AF} recurrence post-{RFA} ({OR}-1.032, {CI}- 1.012–1.052).Patients with {AF} recurrence following {RFA} have a higher mean {LAV}/{LAVi} compared to patients with no recurrence.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The value of left atrial ({LA}) volume and reservoir function ({ResF}) after ablation for atrial fibrillation for predicting overall outcomes needs further investigation, particularly in large cohorts. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that abnormal {LA} volume and {ResF} after ablation are associated with adverse outcomes.
{METHODS}: Patients who underwent primary atrial fibrillation ablation between 2007 and 2016 and had available measurements of maximum {LA} volume index ({LAVImax}) and minimum {LA} volume index ({LAVImin}) and {LA} {ResF} ({LA} emptying fraction and {LA} expansion index) at 3-month echocardiographic examination after ablation were included in this analysis. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiac hospitalization for heart failure or acute ischemic events, stroke or transient ischemic attack, and all-cause death; secondary endpoints were cardiac hospitalization and all-cause death.
{RESULTS}: A total of 792 patients were studied (mean age, 60 ± 10 years). Over a median of 7.5 years (interquartile range, 3.0-9.7 years) of follow-up, 96 patients experienced adverse events. After adjustment for several parameters, including age, comorbidities, and left ventricular structure and function, increased {LA} volumes and impaired {ResF} were each independently associated with the primary endpoint ({LAVImax} {\textgreater} 34 {mL}/m2: adjusted hazard ratio [{HR}], 2.37 [95\% {CI}, 1.49-3.76; P = .0003]; {LAVImin} ≥ 20.5 {mL}/m2: adjusted {HR}, 3.21 [95\% {CI}, 1.97-5.24; P {\textless} .0001]; {LA} emptying fraction {\textless} 40\%: adjusted {HR}, 2.00 [95\% {CI}, 1.29-3.10; P = .002]; {LA} expansion index {\textless} 66\%: adjusted {HR}, 1.91 [95\% {CI}, 1.22-2.98; P = .005]) as well as with the secondary endpoints of cardiac hospitalization (P {\textless} .05 for adjusted {HR} for all {LA} parameters) and all-cause death (P {\textless} .05 for adjusted {HR} for {LAVImin}, {LA} emptying fraction and {LA} expansion index). {ResF} measures were incremental to {LAVImax} (P {\textless} .05 for all), but not to {LAVImin}. In patients with normal {LA} ({LAVImax} ≤ 34 {mL}/m2; n = 403), those with higher {LAVImin} (≥17 {mL}/m2) were at 4 times higher risk for primary endpoint events (age-adjusted {HR}, 4.32; 95\% {CI}, 1.90-9.81; P = .0005). All these findings were independent of atrial tachyarrhythmia recurrence.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Enlarged left atrium and impaired {ResF} at 3 months after ablation for atrial fibrillation are strongly associated with long-term outcomes, independent of left ventricular function or cardiac rhythm at follow-up. {LAVImin} showed the strongest associations and even identified a high-risk subgroup among patients with nondilated left atria.},

	abstract = {Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in the general population and is frequently associated with organic heart disease. β-adrenoceptor antagonists (β-blockers) are very effective in preventing atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass surgery It has been shown recently that the β-blocker metoprolol controlled release/extended release ({CR}/{XL}) is also effective in maintaining sinus rhythm after conversion of atrial fibrillation. There is concern that class I antiarrhythmic drugs, such as quinidine, disopyramide, and flecainide in particular, may increase mortality. The risk of proarrhythmia associated with β-blocker treatment is very low. Therefore β—blockers, such as metoprolol {CR}/{XL}, may be the first line of treatment to maintain sinus rhythm, especially after myocardial infarction and in patients with chronic heart failure and in those with arterial hypertension.},

	abstract = {{AIMS}: The step-wise approach to catheter ablation for persistent atrial fibrillation ({AF}) requires considerable substrate modification targeting at complex fractionated atrial electrograms ({CFAEs}) in addition to pulmonary vein ({PV}) isolation. An alternative strategy that minimizes the amount of ablation would be desirable. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the use of pre-procedural amiodarone affects: (i) the amount of ablation required to achieve procedural success, and (ii) long-term outcomes.
{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We studied 121 consecutive patients with persistent {AF} who underwent catheter ablation. The patients were divided into two groups: Group 1, amiodarone (n = 31); Group 2, other antiarrhythmic drugs or rate control (n = 90). All the patients underwent a step-wise ablation procedure beginning with {PV} isolation, then proceeding with ablation of the {CFAEs} and linear lesions until sinus rhythm was achieved. Mean left atrial cycle length of {AF} ({AFCL}) was recorded at each step. The number of {CFAE} ablation sites was recorded. The number of {CFAE} sites in Group 1 was significantly less than that in Group 2 (P = 0.0121). The {AFCLs} after each step in Group 1 were significantly longer than those in Group 2. The procedure time and the radiofrequency time of {CFAE} ablation in Group 1 were significantly shorter than that in Group 2 (P = 0.0276 and P = 0.0458, respectively). There was no significant difference between the two groups in early and long-term outcomes.
{CONCLUSION}: Use of pre-procedural amiodarone prolongs {AFCL} during catheter ablation and reduces the number of {CFAE} sites requiring ablation to achieve procedural success while maintaining equivalent long-term results.},

{METHODS} {AND} {RESULTS}: We randomly assigned 126 patients, who underwent {RFCA} for {AF}, to the flecainide group (150 or 100 mg/day according to their body weight) or to the control group receiving no {AADs}.

All {AADs} were stopped after the first 3 months and the late arrhythmia recurrences were also evaluated. The primary endpoint rates were 37 and 41\% in the flecainide (143 ± 19 mg/day) and control groups, respectively (log-rank P = 0.76), and those of the secondary endpoint were 10 and 14\%, respectively (log-rank P = 0.45).

	abstract = {Background and purpose: Given the great clinical heterogeneity of atrial fibrillation ({AF}) patients, conventional classification only based on disease subtype or arrhythmia patterns may not adequately characterize this population. We aimed to identify different groups of {AF} patients who shared common clinical phenotypes using cluster analysis and evaluate the association between identified clusters and clinical outcomes. Methods: We performed a hierarchical cluster analysis in {AF} patients from {AMADEUS} and {BOREALIS} trials. The primary outcome was a composite of stroke/thromboembolism ({TE}), cardiovascular ({CV}) death, myocardial infarction, and/or all-cause death. Individual components of the primary outcome and major bleeding were also assessed. Results: We included 3980 {AF} patients treated with the Vitamin-K Antagonist from the {AMADEUS} and {BOREALIS} studies. The analysis identified four clusters in which patients varied significantly among clinical characteristics. Cluster 1 was characterized by patients with low rates of {CV} risk factors and comorbidities; Cluster 2 was characterized by patients with a high burden of {CV} risk factors; Cluster 3 consisted of patients with a high burden of {CV} comorbidities; Cluster 4 was characterized by the highest rates of non-{CV} comorbidities. After a mean follow-up of 365 (standard deviation 187) days, Cluster 4 had the highest cumulative risk of outcomes. Compared with Cluster 1, Cluster 4 was independently associated with an increased risk for the composite outcome (hazard ratio ({HR}) 2.43, 95\% confidence interval ({CI}) 1.70–3.46), all-cause death ({HR} 2.35, 95\% {CI} 1.58–3.49) and major bleeding ({HR} 2.18, 95\% {CI} 1.19–3.96). Conclusions: Cluster analysis identified four different clinically relevant phenotypes of {AF} patients that had unique clinical characteristics and different outcomes. Cluster analysis highlights the high degree of heterogeneity in patients with {AF}, suggesting the need for a phenotype-driven approach to comorbidities, which could provide a more holistic approach to management aimed to improve patients’ outcomes.},

Using meta-analytic techniques, we compared the effects on maintenance of sinus rhythm and mortality of combined groups of patients with chronic {AF} treated with sotalol, quinidine, or a control drug. Rates of conversion at 6 months and mortality were combined for each group after performing sensitivity analysis to test for homogeneity. Bayesian estimates and corresponding 95\% credibility intervals were constructed to compare the probabilities of achieving sinus rhythm and mortality among groups. A literature search revealed 4 sotalol studies, 6 quinidine studies, and 5 control studies that met inclusion criteria established a priori. The point estimates for maintaining normal sinus rhythm (at 6 months) and corresponding credibility intervals for the 3 groups were sotalol 50\% (range 42\% to 58\%), quinidine 53\% (range 48\% to 59\%), and control 32\% (range 26\% to 39\%). When combining and comparing mortality effects, the following studies met the same inclusion criteria: 4 sotalol studies, 9 quinidine studies, and 7 control studies. The point estimates and corresponding credibility intervals for mortality in the 3 groups were sotalol 2.2\% (range 0.6\% to 4.8\%), quinidine 3.0\% (range 1.7\% to 4.7\%), and control 1.1\% (range 0.3\% to 2.4\%). Sotalol and quinidine are comparable in their ability to maintain sinus rhythm at 6 months (about 50\%) and both agents are superior to control. There is a trend for both agents to increase mortality with long-term therapy.

In particular, we implement our algorithm within the scope of 12-lead surface electrocardiogram ({ECG}) reconstruction from intracardiac electrograms ({EGM}) and vice versa. The goal of performing this task is to allow for improved point-of-care monitoring of patients with an implanted device to treat cardiac pathologies. We will achieve this goal with 12-lead {ECG} reconstruction and by providing a new diagnostic tool for classifying five different {ECG} types. The algorithm is evaluated on a dataset retroactively collected from 14 patients. Correlation coefficients calculated between the reconstructed and the actual {ECG} show that the proposed convolutional neural network model represents an efficient, accurate, and superior way to synthesize a 12-lead {ECG} when compared to previous methods. We can also achieve the same reconstruction accuracy with only one {EGM} lead as input. We also tested the model in a non-patient specific way and saw a reasonable correlation coefficient. The model was also executed in the reverse direction to produce {EGM} signals from a 12-lead {ECG} and found that the correlation was comparable to the forward direction. Lastly, we analyzed the features learned in the model and determined that the model learns an overcomplete basis of our 12-lead {ECG} space. We then use this basis of features to create a new diagnostic tool for classifying different {ECG} arrhythmia’s on the {MIT}-{BIH} arrhythmia database with an average accuracy of 0.98.},

	abstract = {The electrocardiogram ({ECG}) is widely used in medicine because it can provide basic information about different types of heart disease. However, {ECG} data are usually disturbed by various types of noise, which can lead to errors in diagnosis by doctors. To address this problem, this study proposes a method for denoising {ECG} based on disentangled autoencoders. A disentangled autoencoder is an improved autoencoder suitable for denoising {ECG} data. In our proposed method, we use a disentangled autoencoder model based on a fully convolutional neural network to effectively separate the clean {ECG} data from the noise. Unlike conventional autoencoders, we disentangle the features of the coding hidden layer to separate the signal-coding features from the noise-coding features. We performed simulation experiments on the {MIT}-{BIH} Arrhythmia Database and found that the algorithm had better noise reduction results when dealing with four different types of noise. In particular, using our method, the average improved signal-to-noise ratios for the three noises in the {MIT}-{BIH} Noise Stress Test Database were 27.45 db for baseline wander, 25.72 db for muscle artefacts, and 29.91 db for electrode motion artefacts. Compared to a denoising autoencoder based on a fully convolutional neural network ({FCN}), the signal-to-noise ratio was improved by an average of 12.57\%. We can conclude that the model has scientific validity. At the same time, our noise reduction method can effectively remove noise while preserving the important information conveyed by the original signal.},

	doi = {10.22489/CinC.2020.164},
	abstract = {Electrocardiography is a commonly applied method of measuring the electrical activity of the heart. The standard 12-lead electrocardiogram ({ECG}) provides sufficient information to allow various heart conditions to be diagnosed. Despite its relative ease of use, the standard {ECG} procedure could benefit from a reduction of leads which may allow for continuous monitoring, for example via a wearable device. In this study, we first investigated the use of variational autoencoders ({VAEs}) to assess what the most representative leads of the standard 12-lead system are. As the {VAE} learns to compress the {ECG} data, it focuses on the parts of the input that is important for the reconstruction. This information is then used to assess which leads are the most useful for a reconstruction task in general. Precordial leads V2, V3 and V4 are shown to contain the most information in the 12-lead {ECG} data. We then investigated the use of a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) architecture capable of learning patient-specific models to accurately impute 11 missing {ECG} signals from a single available lead. Our design is unconventional in that it keeps a two-dimensional structure throughout the fully connected layers. We show that this design outperforms the traditional one-dimensional structure and that these architectures can be affected by the presence of symptoms in recorded heart signals.},

This research presents distribution based missing value imputation, where the distribution of nonmissing values is simulated to create a set of values that are then randomly inserted into to the missing values in the actual data. **Methods:** Distribution imputation was compared to mean imputation in 12 different simulation conditions based on four sample sizes (50, 100, 150, 200) and three different missing value percentages for each of the sample sizes (10 percent, 20 percent, and 30 percent). Each simulation created 1,000 test datasets within each condition for a total of 12,000 simulated datasets. **Results:** Mean based imputation was biased and less accurate than distribution based imputation ({DBI}) in all 12 simulations combinations. {DBI} was more accurate in matching the number of rejected hypotheses as compared to the gold standard. Comparing the calculated p-values for bias where an unbiased estimator would demonstrate a 50/50 split being greater than and less than the gold standard, {DBI} was closer to the gold standard with at 48.7/51.3 split as compared to the 25.8/74.2 split of mean based imputation. **Conclusions:** Distribution imputation was found to be more accurate and unbiased as compared to mean based imputation methods. As a result, when studies are small and do not contain a large number of variables or even in situations where more elaborate imputation methods cannot be done, {DBI} is an accurate and unbiased method.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Researchers are concerned whether multiple imputation ({MI}) or complete case analysis should be used when a large proportion of data are missing. We aimed to provide guidance for drawing conclusions from data with a large proportion of missingness.
Study Design and Setting
Via simulations, we investigated how the proportion of missing data, the fraction of missing information ({FMI}), and availability of auxiliary variables affected {MI} performance. Outcome data were missing completely at random or missing at random ({MAR}).
Results
Provided sufficient auxiliary information was available; {MI} was beneficial in terms of bias and never detrimental in terms of efficiency. Models with similar {FMI} values, but differing proportions of missing data, also had similar precision for effect estimates. In the absence of bias, the {FMI} was a better guide to the efficiency gains using {MI} than the proportion of missing data.
Conclusion
We provide evidence that for {MAR} data, valid {MI} reduces bias even when the proportion of missingness is large. We advise researchers to use {FMI} to guide choice of auxiliary variables for efficiency gain in imputation analyses, and that sensitivity analyses including different imputation models may be needed if the number of complete cases is small.},

Due to the scarcity of positive samples and other factors, there is currently no algorithm that is comparable to human experts in {ECG} morphological recognition. Our objective is to develop an {ECG} specialist-level deep learning method that can accurately identify ten {ECG} morphological abnormalities in real scene data.
{METHODS}: We established a short-duration 12-lead {ECG} image dataset that consists of approximately 200,000 samples. To address the problems with small positive samples, a data augmentation method was proposed. We solved it by interpolating in the latent space of the vector quantized variational autoencoder ({VQ}-{VAE}) and generating new samples via sampling. The trained final classifier, general doctors, and {ECG} specialists evaluated the diagnostic performance on a test set that consisted of 1000 samples.
{RESULTS}: Relative to that of unaugmented data, the F1 score was improved by 0-6\%. Compared with {ECG} specialists, the deep neural network achieved higher F1 scores and sensitivity in most categories.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Our method can improve the classification performance of {ECG} data with insufficient positive samples and reach the level of {ECG} specialists. This approach can provide specialized reference opinions for ordinary clinicians and reduce the errors of {ECG} specialists.},

	abstract = {Autoencoders are a self-supervised learning system where, during training, the output is an approximation of the input. Typically, autoencoders have three parts: Encoder (which produces a compressed latent space representation of the input data), the Latent Space (which retains the knowledge in the input data with reduced dimensionality but preserves maximum information) and the Decoder (which reconstructs the input data from the compressed latent space). Autoencoders have found wide applications in dimensionality reduction, object detection, image classification, and image denoising applications. Variational Autoencoders ({VAEs}) can be regarded as enhanced Autoencoders where a Bayesian approach is used to learn the probability distribution of the input data. {VAEs} have found wide applications in generating data for speech, images, and text. In this paper, we present a general comprehensive overview of variational autoencoders. We discuss problems with the {VAEs} and present several variants of the {VAEs} that attempt to provide solutions to the problems. We present applications of variational autoencoders for finance (a new and emerging field of application), speech/audio source separation, and biosignal applications. Experimental results are presented for an example of speech source separation to illustrate the powerful application of variants of {VAE}: {VAE}, β-{VAE}, and {ITL}-{AE}. We conclude the paper with a summary, and we identify possible areas of research in improving performance of {VAEs} in particular and deep generative models in general, of which {VAEs} and generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) are examples.},

	abstract = {During the last decade, Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) have become the de facto standard for various Computer Vision and Machine Learning operations. {CNNs} are feed-forward Artificial Neural Networks ({ANNs}) with alternating convolutional and subsampling layers. Deep 2D {CNNs} with many hidden layers and millions of parameters have the ability to learn complex objects and patterns providing that they can be trained on a massive size visual database with ground-truth labels. With a proper training, this unique ability makes them the primary tool for various engineering applications for 2D signals such as images and video frames. Yet, this may not be a viable option in numerous applications over 1D signals especially when the training data is scarce or application specific. To address this issue, 1D {CNNs} have recently been proposed and immediately achieved the state-of-the-art performance levels in several applications such as personalized biomedical data classification and early diagnosis, structural health monitoring, anomaly detection and identification in power electronics and electrical motor fault detection. Another major advantage is that a real-time and low-cost hardware implementation is feasible due to the simple and compact configuration of 1D {CNNs} that perform only 1D convolutions (scalar multiplications and additions). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the general architecture and principals of 1D {CNNs} along with their major engineering applications, especially focused on the recent progress in this field. Their state-of-the-art performance is highlighted concluding with their unique properties. The benchmark datasets and the principal 1D {CNN} software used in those applications are also publicly shared in a dedicated website. While there has not been a paper on the review of 1D {CNNs} and its applications in the literature, this paper fulfills this gap.},

	abstract = {Background
The success of pulmonary vein isolation ({PVI}) is reduced in persistent {AF} ({PsAF}) compared to paroxysmal {AF}. Adjunctive ablation strategies have failed to show consistent incremental benefit over {PVI} alone in randomized studies. The left atrial posterior wall is a potential source of non-{PV} triggers and atrial substrate which may promote the initiation and maintenance of {PsAF}. Adding posterior wall isolation ({PWI}) to {PVI} had shown conflicting outcomes, with earlier studies confounded by methodological limitations.
Objectives
To determine whether combining {PWI} with {PVI} significantly improves freedom from {AF} recurrence, compared to {PVI} alone, in patients with {PsAF}.
Methods
This is a multi-center, prospective, international randomized clinical trial. 338 patients with symptomatic {PsAF} refractory to anti-arrhythmic therapy ({AAD}) will be randomized to either {PVI} alone or {PVI} with {PWI} in a 1:1 ratio. {PVI} involves wide antral circumferential pulmonary vein ({PV}) isolation, utilizing contact force sensing ablation catheters. {PWI} involves the creation of a floor line connecting the inferior aspect of the {PVs}, and a roof line connecting the superior aspect of the {PVs}. Follow up is for a minimum of 12 months with rhythm monitoring via implantable cardiac device and/or loop monitor, or frequent intermittent monitoring with an {ECG} device. The primary outcome is freedom from any documented atrial arrhythmia of {\textgreater} 30 seconds off {AAD} at 12 months, after a single ablation procedure.
Conclusions
This randomized study aims to determine the success and safety of adjunctive {PWI} to {PVI} in patients with persistent {AF}.},

Through meticulous electrophysiologic studies ({EPS}), researchers have gained insight into the mechanisms of cardiac arrhythmias, developing very effective ablative therapies. The purpose of an {EPS} is to record intracardiac signals not obvious in the surface electrocardiogram ({ECG}) and to assess their timing and their relationship to the simultaneously recorded {ECG} signals. The interpretation of these recordings is perceived, however, as complex and confusing by many young cardiologists. In this review, we will provide a brief introduction to the basic findings of an {EPS}.

	abstract = {Catheter ablation of critical electrical propagation sites is a promising tool for reducing the recurrence of atrial fibrillation ({AF}). The spatial identification of the arrhythmogenic mechanisms sustaining {AF} requires the evaluation of electrograms ({EGMs}) recorded over the atrial surface. This work aims to characterize functional reentries using measures of entropy to track and detect a reentry core. To this end, different {AF} episodes are simulated using a 2D model of atrial tissue. Modified Courtemanche human action potential and Fenton–Karma models are implemented. Action potential propagation is modeled by a fractional diffusion equation, and virtual unipolar {EGM} are calculated. Episodes with stable and meandering rotors, figure-of-eight reentry, and disorganized propagation with multiple reentries are generated. Shannon entropy ({ShEn}), approximate entropy ({ApEn}), and sample entropy ({SampEn}) are computed from the virtual {EGM}, and entropy maps are built. Phase singularity maps are implemented as references. The results show that {ApEn} and {SampEn} maps are able to detect and track the reentry core of rotors and figure-of-eight reentry, while the {ShEn} results are not satisfactory. Moreover, {ApEn} and {SampEn} consistently highlight a reentry core by high entropy values for all of the studied cases, while the ability of {ShEn} to characterize the reentry core depends on the propagation dynamics. Such features make the {ApEn} and {SampEn} maps attractive tools for the study of {AF} reentries that persist for a period of time that is similar to the length of the observation window, and reentries could be interpreted as {AF}-sustaining mechanisms. Further research is needed to determine and fully understand the relation of these entropy measures with fibrillation mechanisms other than reentries.},

	abstract = {Background
Atrial fibrillation is the most frequent cardiac arrhythmia. It has been estimated that 6–12 million people worldwide will suffer this condition in the {US} by 2050 and 17.9 million people in Europe by 2060. Atrial fibrillation is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke and provokes important economic burden along with significant morbidity and mortality.
Aim
We provide here comprehensive and updated statistics on worldwide epidemiology of atrial fibrillation.
Methods
An electronic search was conducted for atrial fibrillation. The epidemiologic information was retrieved from the Global Health Data Exchange database, which is regarded as one of the most comprehensive worldwide catalogs of surveys, censuses, vital statistics, and other health-related data.
Results
A total of 3.046 million new cases of atrial fibrillation worldwide were registered in the database during 2017. The estimated incidence rate for 2017 (403/millions inhabitants) was 31\% higher than the corresponding incidence in 1997. The worldwide prevalence of atrial fibrillation is 37,574 million cases (0.51\% of worldwide population), increased also by 33\% during the last 20 years. The highest burden is seen in countries with high socio-demographic index, though the largest recent increased occurred in middle socio-demographic index countries. Future projections suggest that absolute atrial fibrillation burden may increase by {\textgreater}60\% in 2050.
Conclusions
Our analyses suggest that atrial fibrillation incidence and prevalence have increased over the last 20 years and will continue to increase over the next 30 years, especially in countries with middle socio-demographic index, becoming one of the largest epidemics and public health challenges.},
